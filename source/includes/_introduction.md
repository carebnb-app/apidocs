# Introduction

Welcome to Carebnb API!

The Carebnb API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).
Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [form-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)#Use_for_submitting_web_forms) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Access

To have access to our API, you will need partner credentials.
These credentials are granted to hosting businesses that use our automation services.

If you're not a partner yet, but see yourself as a good candidate, please contact us through the email [host@carebnb.app](mailto:host@carebnb.app)
